wmconfig from PLD is slightly "improved".
When wmconfig produce output for blackbox, at the end
file $MY_BLACKBOX_MENU is included, eg.
MY_BLACKBOX_MENU=/etc/X11/blackbox/appendix

and that file contains
	[submenu] (Style) {Which style?}
		[stylesdir] (/usr/X11R6/share/blackbox/styles)
	[end]
	[config] (Config Options)
	[reconfig] (Reconfigure)
	[restart] (Restart)
	[exit] (Exit)

Mustn't be (or even shouldn't be) "[end]" at the end of this this file,
because "[end]" is produced by wmconfig.
